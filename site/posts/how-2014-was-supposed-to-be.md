I was reading over some old digital marketing whitepapers, and saw this:

> The days of agonizing over Excel spreadsheets and antiquated lead management platforms are gone. 2014 needs to be all about sales automation technologies that automate mundane sales tasksÂ such as tracking customer interactions, analyzing sales forecasts, and assessing the progress of leads. The right automation platform will pair a robust CRM solution with an easy-to-use web-based portal to simplify and expedite the lead generation and management process.

It is 2019, and I regularly meet companies that are still agonising over Excel spreadsheets of leads that are being emailed back and forth.

Things change slowly.
