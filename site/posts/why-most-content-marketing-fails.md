Most content marketing campaigns fail because they are stopped too early.

Take any great youtube star, and go back and look at their earliest videos (if they haven’t deleted them). Often pretty bad. Awkward, with poor production. But they stuck at it, improved and learned, and worked to build a community.

With written content, some of the best search rankings and traffic can come after 3 months. Yup, that's when you can start figuring out which of your content pieces is performing and which isn’t. Some stuff will disappoint you and some will surprise you.

Content marketing has to be about creating long-term value for your audience. You need to believe that what you are saying is important enough to stay the course, to keep learning and improving over time.

In short - if you are not willing to commit at least 6 months to a content marketing program, it might be better to look at other ways to spend your time and money.
