It is easy to get caught up in thoughts about what you don’t have, that others do.

Born at the right time, in the right place, into the right family. Thinner, taller, smarter. Richer. Naturally muscular, naturally coordinated. Eye colour, skin colour, voice.

But all of these things are outside our control. The birth and genetic dice were thrown long ago. It is a waste of time and energy to complain.

Many marketers waste their time and energy by focussing on all the opportunities that other marketing teams seem to have. “If I had their budgets, I could do amazing work…..”. “If my management were more adventurous/visionary then I could do great campaigns…..” “If we could afford an agency as good as theirs…..” “If my product was as interesting/beautiful as theirs….”

There are amazing (and viral) marketing campaigns from companies that are smaller, with lower budgets and more boring products than yours.
