I saw this data in a report that had surveyed B2B marketing managers,

ATTRIBUTION MODELS USED TO MEASURE DIGITAL MARKETING ROI  
  
WE DON'T HAVE AN ATTRIBUTION MODEL 25.0%  
MULTICHANNEL (ALL INFLUENCING TOUCH POINTS) 17.0%  
FIRST AND LAST TOUCH (LEAD SOURCE & CONVERTING CAMPAIGN) 14.0%  
FIRST TOUCH (LEAD SOURCE) 13.0%  
LAST TOUCH (CONVERTING CAMPAIGN) 12.3%  
NOT SURE 10.6%  
Source: Wpromote, 2017 State of B2B Digital Marketing, 2017.

The first thing that jumped out at me was that 35% either don’t know or don’t have any attribution model. Then I realised that those were probably the most honest answers. I would guess that many marketing heads that picked one of the other responses either answered on what they thought they should be doing, or on what sounded familiar.

Multichannel is the toughest one on the list to pull off, not just in gathering the data, but in analysing it for meaningful insights.

From what i have seen, if the CRM is good at de-duping, then the first touch (original lead source) usually overrides the later records. Otherwise, the most recent source (last touch) gets the credit because the data is a mess.

The journey is often complicated by siloed teams and data. The lead gen team claims success for a sale based on first touch, and the lead nurturing and content team claims success based on last touch. Some companies use different systems for sales than for initial enquiry handling, and data gets lost in-between.
