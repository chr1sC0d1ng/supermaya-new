When we watch sports, the commentary is full of averages. Average possession time. Average runs per over. Average scores per match, or per season. Average time per lap. For each sport, there are metrics that are generally recognized as important.

Most averages are objective. They are measurable, and there is no disagreement.

There are many averages that are subjective. How collaborative was a player? How much effort did they put in? How cleanly did they play? How exciting were they to watch?

The subjective averages are also important, because these are how we are assessed every day.

When you submit a report, you are changing the average that others perceive of your report quality, or report presentation, or submission timelines.

When you pitch a new idea, you are changing the average of how others perceive your quality of ideas, clarity of thinking, presentation skills.

When you write a scene for a film. When you design a webpage. When you install electrical wiring. When you deliver a lecture. When you serve a customer.

Whatever it is that you do, you are always making your average better, or worse. Either way, it is your decision.
