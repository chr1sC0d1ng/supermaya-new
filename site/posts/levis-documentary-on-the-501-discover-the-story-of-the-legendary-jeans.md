Many of the pieces of clothing that we take for granted today began as a unique invention – like a collision of engineering, design and tailoring. Take jeans, for example:

- The word jeans may come from from ‘Genes’, the French word for Genoa, Italy, a town that made early jean cloth
- Nimes, another town, made their own version, which was called ‘de Nimes’ (from Nimes) - later simplified to denim.
- In the late 1800s, Levi Strauss patented a method of using metal rivets at key stress points on trousers made from demin, with 2 front pockets and 1 back pocket. These new trousers became popular with miners and then factory workers – creating the modern blue jean.
- Almost all blue jeans were dyed with indigo from India!

Blue Jeans have also remained in fashion, in one way or another for the last century. Different cuts and styles have appalled to anyone from rural laborers to hippies, to heavy metal fans. Dark blue, nicely styled jeans are even worn today as smart/casual office wear.

To celebrate the Levi’s iconic 501 jean, the company has put out a 3 part documentary, exploring the history, design and role of the product in popular culture. This is very nice brand storytelling that helps us to understand both the product, and the passion of the people who create it.
