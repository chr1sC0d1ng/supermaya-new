The most important question in digital advertising is “what are we going to improve this week?”

Go ahead, get excited about all the new technology, the AI future, the chatbots. Plan your big website redesign, and the upcoming product launch, and the new budget.

Don’t forget the basics of what makes digital marketing so powerful.
