When we do something well, it’s because of our skill and talent.

When we don’t do something well, it’s because of other people.

Someone else didn’t approve my work on time, or didn’t give me the inputs I need, or gave me too much other work.

It’s always easier for other people to lose weight, or get fit, or be promoted, or write a book.
