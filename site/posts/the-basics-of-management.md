The basics of management are pretty simple.

Strategy: 1. What do you want to achieve? 2. How will you measure progress and success? 3. What steps will you take to get there?

Project Management 1. What needs to be done? 2. By who? 3. By When? 4. What should they do if they can’t do it by then?

Of course, these are just the basics and the real world is far more complicated. But it’s crazy how often the basics get skipped.
