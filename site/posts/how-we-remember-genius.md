Isaac Newton is best known for his principles of physics, and his work in mathematics and astronomy. But he also spent much of his life working on alchemy: the belief that you could transform other metals to gold.

Steve Jobs is thought of as a genius. But he also insisted on driving a car with no numberplate, sometimes parked in disabled spaces, fired his employees on the spot for small mistakes, and would often wash his feet in the company toilets to relieve stress.  

I was going to add Pythagorus, the genius mathematician who also founded a religion whose rules included not eating or touching beans, don’t walk on the highway, and don’t pick up things that fall. Then I learnt that most of his ‘discoveries’ have been falsely attributed to him. 

### Lessons on genius:

At the time we have no way to know which crazy ideas will turn out to be genius, if any.

There were lots of other crazy people around, but by luck and timing, a few crazy people had the chance to get some of their ideas into public knowledge.

Imitating their wacky behaviour does not make you a genius too. Sorry, but being rude to everyone will not turn you into the next Steve Jobs.
