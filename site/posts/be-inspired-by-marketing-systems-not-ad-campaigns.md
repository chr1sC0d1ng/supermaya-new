We all see marketing campaigns that inspire us. It might be an amazing TV commercial, or a social media strategy, or a video that seems to get viral views.

It is easy to look at individual campaigns and imagine that you should do something similar. Campaigns are fairly easy to copy. Just as Bollywood is ‘inspired’ by the scripts of international films, so advertising is ‘inspired’ by existing campaigns.

What is harder, but so much more important, is to be inspired by the systems that created those campaigns.

Who was the team? How are they structured? What process did they follow? What freedoms were they allowed? What came before this campaign? What relationship do they have with their agencies? What came next?

In manufacturing, they know that the system is everything. A company that can consistently design, produce, and distribute beautiful products (whether mobile phones, cars, or tables) does so because of the systems they have in place. Not because of random brilliance or inspiration.

In marketing, we fall into the trap of believing that companies who consistently produce great marketing somehow achieve this through pure individual creativity, or more budgets, or ‘braver’ management.

Copy systems, rather than campaigns to find your own marketing excellence. (so that others start to copy you)
