I recently shared some numbers on last years sales of video games vs film box office that many found amazing:  
Global video game sales: $150 billion  
Global film box office: $43 billion

Note that the numbers change depending on sources and what is counted, but no one disagrees that the video game industry is pulling in more money than film. Most sources agree that video games sales are higher than film + music + streaming subscriptions combined.

Despite this, whenever a new video game puts out a beautiful trailer or ad, lots of people are amazed. “This looks so expensive.” “ What an incredible trailer for a ….. video game!”

Here is a recent Playstation ad

And an Xbox one. Father and daughter and jedi.

Beautiful work.

As a comparison, the game GTA V generated more revenue than Avatar and Titanic combined. Thats why you go all out on stunning ads. When there are so many games to choose from, you have to sell the emotion and story, rather than just the gameplay experience. Just like films?
