Let’s face it: If all marketers were more like GE, the online ad world would be a far more interesting space.

As GE’s CMO Linda Boff says, “"As a brand, we are constantly thinking about what's new and next for the world with our technology, and to mirror that it in our marketing and the way we tell our story," she said. "It is representative of how we think as a company -- it's in our DNA."

For Inventor’s Day last week, GE released three new videos titled “Impossible Missions”. Each video challenges GE’s research division to use science to disprove a commonly used phrase:

## A snowballs chance in hell (an unlikely or impossible event)

## Like catching lighting in a bottle (so difficult that it is impossible)

https://youtu.be/eSWIRAY9EBU

 

## Like talking to a wall (the person you are talking to can’t or won’t listen)

https://youtu.be/eCQ-M2-kVhE

 

The videos are well made and engaging, sort of like mini mythbuster’s episodes and carry the clear brand message of GE’s inventive approach to science and technology. Within days, the campaign was referenced by thousands of websites – most importantly the science and tech blogs that can amplify the campaign.

GE also put out a slide deck to hightlight the researchers who solved the tech problems behind each challenge.
